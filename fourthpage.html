   <div class="fall-text">
   <p>If an idea exists but is never found,<br>
    then the stained-glass windows</p> 

    <p>will reflect nothing back to the ear.<br>
        Most days filter through the mind,
    </p> 

    <p>waiting not for movement <br>
        but for a road to be built,
         </p> 

    <p>brick by brick, word by word, <br> </p> 

    <p>weariness replaced with joy, <br>
        but what is joy without the years</p> 

    <p>and the way they open constantly, <br>
        two or three hearts pumping a volume of blood
         </p> 

    <p>and the way they open constantly, <br>
        two or three hearts pumping a volume of blood
         </p> 

    <p>         Our disbelief in the ordinary <br>
        emerges from the way we color routine:
         </p> 

    <p>leaves pile up depending on the wind, <br>
        but why pause to notice?</p> 

    <p>Eventually the seasons embrace <br>
        what our words will not, the illuminated day
         </p> 

    <p>just one of a thousand others, <br>
        and the names we give back to the world</p> 

    <p>mean ultimately little against the way</p> 

    <p>the sun pleads sense <br>
        from the smallest cradle of dew.
