    <div class="summer-text">
    <p>Before the moths have even appeared <br>
        to orbit around them, the streetlamps come on,<br>
        a long row of them glowing uselessly</p>
         
        <p>along the ring of garden that circles the city center,<br>
        where your steps count down the dulling of daylight.<br>
        At your feet, a bee crawls in small circles like a toy unwinding.<br></p>
         
        <p>Summer specializes in time, slows it down almost to dream.<br>
        And the noisy day goes so quiet you can hear<br>
        the bedraggled man who visits each trash receptacle<br></p>
         
        <p>mutter in disbelief: Everything in the world is being thrown away!<br>
        Summer lingers, but it’s about ending. It’s about how things<br>
        redden and ripen and burst and come down. It’s when<br> </p>
         
        <p>city workers cut down trees, demolishing<br>
        one limb at a time, spilling the crumbs<br>
        of twigs and leaves all over the tablecloth of street.<br></p>
         
        <p>Sunglasses! the man softly exclaims<br>
        while beside him blooms a large gray rose of pigeons<br>
        huddled around a dropped piece of bread.</p>
