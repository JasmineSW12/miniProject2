    <div class="winter-text">
 
    <p>Under the magnolia, a winter-starved hare stills <br>
     and pretends it is not there,
     </p>
 
     <p>and wanting less of fearfulness <br>
         I pretend that I do not see my camouflage, <br>
         the wild promises in my gaze, and <br>
         step carefully by.
         </p>
 
     <p>Morning, bitter morning—<br>
         lack and awful patience wait at every 
         compass point.<br> Mourning, mournful, 
         the prairie eals wind-scored <br>
         stems with snow.
          </p>
 
     <p>Here inside a stalk of goldenrod <br>
         a gall wasp will ride hard winter out.</p>
 
     <p>Here between my ribs, wasps of lonely, wasps of <br>
         not yet, not yet wait and ride hard winter out.</p>
 
     <p>Such a slow season, laggard and mean. <br>
         I can’t explain the cardinals I’ve seen of late,
         </p>
     
     <p>but the crows’ black fists, the way they bully <br>
         eave and air, stab the morning with the sharpest awe,</p>
 
     <p>I understand it now. I see the reason and agree.
